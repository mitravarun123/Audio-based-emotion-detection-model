# Audio-based Emotion Detection Model

## Overview

This project is an **Audio-based Emotion Detection** model that extracts features from audio data to predict emotions. The model analyzes audio signals using various techniques to identify emotional states based on audio features such as pitch, tone, and speech tempo. It integrates a **graphical method** to visualize the extracted features from input audio, making it easier to understand and interpret the results.

## Features

* **Audio Feature Extraction**: The model extracts various audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), Chroma feature, spectral contrast, and tonnetz, which are commonly used in emotion detection from speech.
* **Emotion Detection**: The extracted features are used to train a machine learning model to classify emotions in audio recordings.
* **Graphical Visualization**: In addition to the detection, the model provides graphical plots of the extracted features, allowing you to visually inspect the patterns and trends in the audio data.
* **Accuracy**: Currently, the model achieves an accuracy of **68%**. The model is still being improved to enhance performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mitravarun123/Audio-based-emotion-detection-model.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Audio-based-emotion-detection-model
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dependencies

* **Python 3.x**
* **Librosa**: For audio signal processing.
* **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For graphical visualizations.
* **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning utilities.

## Usage

1. **Feature Extraction**: To extract features from an audio file, use the provided script:

   ```bash
   python extract_features.py --audio_file <path_to_audio_file>
   ```

2. **Model Training**: To train the emotion detection model, run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Emotion Prediction**: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict emotions in new audio files:

   ```bash
   python predict_emotion.py --audio_file <path_to_audio_file>
   ```

4. **Graphical Method**: You can visualize the extracted features and the accuracy of the model using the graphical method provided in `feature_visualization.py`. This helps you inspect how the model is interpreting the audio data.

   ```bash
   python feature_visualization.py --audio_file <path_to_audio_file>
   ```

## Future Improvements

* **Accuracy Enhancement**: The current model accuracy is **68%**. Ongoing work is being done to improve the model's performance using advanced techniques like fine-tuning hyperparameters, experimenting with different models, and exploring more complex feature extraction methods.
* **Integration of Additional Emotion Labels**: We plan to incorporate more diverse emotional labels for broader classification.
* **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Future versions of the project will include real-time emotion detection from live audio inputs.
